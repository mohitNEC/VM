Batch Operation
***************

Batch operation use when multiple entities would be created by user.

Batch queries support following operations:

1. Create multiple entities 
2. Upsert multiple entity 
3. Update multiple entity 
4. Delete multiple entity.
  
For example: take a car as a entity1 and another car as a entity2 and room as a entity3.all have some attributes in case of car brand name and speed are an attribute and in case of room temperature is attribute so we can create/update all the entities by single request through the entity batch operation support.

Batch Operation Response Codes
##############################
