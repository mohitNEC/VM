RELEASE NOTES
Scorpio 2.0:

With the release we are moving to NGSI-LD 1.3.1. In the following weeks we will update the documentation where needed. 
------------------------------------------------------
Attention: Be aware there are breaking changes in the core context of NGSI-LD 1.3.1 compared to 1.2.2 which we supported before. Currently we have to recommend users with an existing dataset to wait with the update until we provide a migration tool to migrate the data from 1.2.2 to 1.3.1
------------------------------------------------------

What is in this release:

1. Performance improvements on NGSI-LD compacting and expanding
2. Introducing multiple flavours of Scorpio. Using maven profiles we provide 4 different flavours of Scorpio. 
  - 2 of them are our original flavours providing an All In One variant and a distributed setup with Spring Cloud in front enabling scaling through Spring Cloud's gateway and eureka discovery server 
  - all in one runner without dependencies to eureka enabling faster start up times and allowing scaling from external gateways/loadbalancers
  - distributed without dependencies to eureka enabling faster start up times and allowing scaling from external gateways/loadbalancers
3. improved core context handling. The default core context is now configured via the property ngsild.corecontext and will be always used
4. reorganization of kafka topics. We have reduced the amount of used kafka topics to 5 and reduced the amount of data transmitted through kafka
5. Updating to newer versions of kafka and postgres in our default docker-compose files.
6. Integration of the spring actuator plugin providing various infos like health or log via the /actuator/info endpoint
7. persistance of subscriptions in postgres 
8. various bugfixes
9. updated Spring Boot to version 2.6.2 and base Java image to Java 17 
10. Updated configuration. We have updated our configuration to allow an easier reconfiguration from the user side. These settings can all be set via environment variables. The format for setting those is capital letters and subsections devided by an underscore so e.g.: SCORPIO_GATEWAYURL  An overview of the current settings can be seen below.

Scorpio FIWARE 8.1.0
 - This release mainly contains optimizations of the tenant support.
 - Various bugfixes where done to the history manager.
 - History manager supports the directDB flag now and it is set by default
 - Minor fixes which to bugs introduces in 8.0.0 (wrong return codes etc.) 
Scorpio FIWARE 8.0.0
 - This release contains as main update multi tenant support. This means scorpio supports the "ngsild-tenant" header to support data separation. On the cSource side of things we do support the short name tenant in the payload and respect it in all operations. In this release we still support the v1.2.2 core context so this is effectivly a back port of the tenant feature into 1.2.2. This has an implication on the expanded stored versions of registrations. In this release they will be stored as extra property with the default prefix.
 - As we progress to merge in 1.3.1 changes we will provide the necessary migration scripts to adapt this, however anyone dealing directly with the database or kafka (which you shouldn't) be aware.
 - Tenant Entity create handling: If you create an entity with a tenant the subsequent csource registration and temporal entity creations from scorpio will also be in the registry and temporal database for the provided tenant.
 - Federated queries/subscriptions: Similar to the create queries/subscriptions will only ever use the registry of the provided tenant.
 - Default Tenant: If no tenant header is provided scorpio will behave in its default behaviour.
 - Various bugfixes were adressed 
Scorpio FIWARE 7.8.2 
 - The release contains various bugfixes as well as support for Kubernetes using Helm files. 
 - CI was changed to github actions from travis ci. 
 - spring_args in docker-compose will now be forwarded to the gateway as well. this allows external configuration of oauth without changing the application.yml file.
 - various bugfixes for subscription triggering
